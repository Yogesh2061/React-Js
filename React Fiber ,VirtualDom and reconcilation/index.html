            <h2>Introduction to React Fiber</h2>
            <p>React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm that optimizes performance for areas like animations, layout, and gestures. 
            It introduces incremental rendering, which allows React to handle rendering work in smaller chunks across multiple frames, significantly enhancing efficiency.</p>

            <h2>The Need for Scheduling in React</h2>
            <p>Scheduling is the process of determining <span class="highlight">when work should happen</span>. 
            In a UI, not every update needs to be applied immediately, as it may cause frame drops and degrade user experience. 
            React Fiber's scheduling capabilities allow for delayed updates, prioritization of animations, and improved rendering efficiency.</p>

            <h2>What Are Fibers?</h2>
            <p>A "<span class="highlight">fiber</span>" is a unit of work in React Fiber's architecture, similar to a virtual stack frame that enables the framework to control and prioritize tasks. 
            With fibers, React can <span class="highlight">pause, resume, or cancel work</span> as needed, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Concepts: Reconciliation and the Virtual DOM</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Reconciliation</span> is the algorithm that React uses to determine which parts of the UI need updating, enabling efficient updates without re-rendering the entire application. This process is closely tied to the <span class="highlight">virtual DOM</span>, a concept that allows React to keep a representation of the UI in memory to minimize direct interactions with the real DOM, improving performance.</p>

            <h2>Key Benefits of React Fiber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enables smoother animations and transitions.</li>
                <li>Improves efficiency in updating only the necessary parts of the UI.</li>
                <li>Allows React to prioritize user interactions over background updates.</li>
            </ul>
